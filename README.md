# ArtDB

This application is a tool for learning about some of the most famous masterpieces of Art History. It allows you to search a database (similar to IMDB for movies), create an account, and save your favorite art, artists, and musuems to your user profile.
Whether you are a student, teacher, or traveler, your favorites will also map out where the art lives in the world, telling you which cities and collections to visit to see the art in person.
