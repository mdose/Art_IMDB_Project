Donatello		1386	1466	Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi (c. 1386 – 13 December 1466), better known as Donatello (Italian: [donaˈtɛllo]), was an Italian Renaissance sculptor from Florence. He studied classical sculpture and used this to develop a complete Renaissance style in sculpture, whose periods in Rome, Padua and Siena introduced to other parts of Italy a long and productive career. He worked with stone, bronze, wood, clay, stucco and wax, and had several assistants, with four perhaps being a typical number. Though his best-known works were mostly statues in the round, he developed a new, very shallow, type of bas-relief for small works, and a good deal of his output was larger architectural reliefs.	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Cinque_maestri_del_rinascimento_fiorentino%2C_XVI_sec%2C_donatello.JPG/800px-Cinque_maestri_del_rinascimento_fiorentino%2C_XVI_sec%2C_donatello.JPG

He is often considered one of the founders of Early Netherlandish painting school and one of the most significant representatives of Northern Renaissance art.	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Portrait_of_a_Man_in_a_Turban_%28Jan_van_Eyck%29_with_frame.jpg/800px-Portrait_of_a_Man_in_a_Turban_%28Jan_van_Eyck%29_with_frame.jpg
Michelangelo	di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni	1475	1564	Natural born sculptor who was forced to paint way too much thanks to the bully popes he worked. Understandably, he developed a temper.	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Miguel_%C3%81ngel%2C_por_Daniele_da_Volterra_%28detalle%29.jpg/800px-Miguel_%C3%81ngel%2C_por_Daniele_da_Volterra_%28detalle%29.jpg
Raphael		1483	1520	Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino[2] (Italian: [raffaˈɛllo ˈsantsjo da urˈbiːno]; March 28 or April 6, 1483 – April 6, 1520),[3] known as Raphael (/ˈræfeɪəl/, US: /ˈræfiəl, ˌrɑːfaɪˈɛl/), was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.[4]	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Raffaello_Sanzio.jpg/800px-Raffaello_Sanzio.jpg
