      This application is a tool for learning about some of the most famous
      masterpieces of Art History. It allows you to search a database (similar
      to IMDB for movies); create an account; and save your favorite art, artists,
      and museums to your user profile. Whether you are a student, teacher, or
      traveler, your profile will also map out where the art lives in the world,
      telling you which cities and art collections to visit to see the art in person.
